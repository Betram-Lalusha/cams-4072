Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Awesome job here!  One thing to keep in mind: since the requirements are
   numbered, you DON'T want them to show up in the table of contents.  You
   can configure that table so it doesn't use more than one or two levels,
   that way the requirements won't be part of the table of contents.

-- Functional Requirements
   Nailed it.  No further comments

-- Performance Requirements
   Nailed it again!  No further comments

-- Environment Requirements
   Third time's a charm.  I have no other comments on this document.

=============================================================================
your score:  10% out of 10% which is an A-plus

All in all, this is CRAZY good, Betram!

You have the full 10% on this deliverable.  Good work!
