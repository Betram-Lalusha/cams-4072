-- General Comments
   EXCELLENT work on this document, Betram!  You really nailed this ~ the
   deliverables section in particular is right on the money.  Also, I like
   the way you divided the tasks up by the Designer and Engineer without
   putting a name for them ~ a good way to make those assignments!
