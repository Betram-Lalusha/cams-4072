CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Betram Lalusha
Visor project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is complete enough to provide
   the reader with the required information, without making it so 'deep'
   that it gets too detailed.

   The justification section is also well done.  Using the numbered list is
   a good approach, and models the requirements and design documents that we
   see in the industry.  I especially like the learning aspects of the app,
   and that you have allowed for expansion and future development.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look great, your justification
   of both the project goals and the applicability to the course are well-
   thought-out and clear.  This is a very useful project!  Your presentation
   skills were very professional and the graphics are great.  Very engaging.


=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
