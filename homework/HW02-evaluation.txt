Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.4, good approach to use a hybrid of three architectures for the chess
game!  That's thinking outside the box...

Nice job on the state diagram in 5.8.

I like the table approach for showing the sharing of properties ~ that's a
nice succinct way to show this information!

Nice work on the inheritance diagram, too.

Good job overall ~ you're doing great, Betram, keep it up!!
